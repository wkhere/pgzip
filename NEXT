+ accept file args, use '-' for stdin/stdout
+ check if pgzip.Reader needs safeClose

- args changes:
  - treat all arg files as input, like classic gzip
  - thus: guess output file (add/remove suffix, error if can't be guessed)
  - output to stdout with -c
    - with multiple input files, all inputs are processed into one output
  - input from stdin if input given as '-'
    - implies -c
    - '-' can't be mixed with files
