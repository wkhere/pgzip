Comparing C gzip and golang pgzip.

On my laptop,
compression speed is where pgzip is faster for sure for ~38MB input,
probably for smaller too.

Decompression, ~100MB of input is where pgzip starts to be faster.


Note: pigz decompression is faster. Still, this pgzip can shine where
there is no way to install or compile pigz, as Go cross-compilation
is a piece of cake.
Surprisingly, pgzip compression is faster than pigz!
